"Not “free”, rather “with a different pricing structure” where it all rolls into a higher percentage on each transaction rather than a lower percentage plus a monthly fee. I used to use Payleven in my shop but switched to a rented Barclaycard machine as the monthly subscription was offset by much cheaper percentages. For low turnover businesses something like Square/SumUp/iZettle will be cheaper overall but as turnover grows the higher percentage becomes more significant.

"I looked at these guys a while back and my understanding was that they charged a flat fee of 1.75% on any card and regardless of the number of transaction processed. Based on the £60pm cited you would still need to be at somewhat less than a £3,000pm to see any real advantage. They do have an amazing set of API’s though.

"I create eCommerce websites for small businesses that don’t principally trade online, so their major concern is that they pay that £60 per month for the facility whether they get payments through the site or not. It’s a case of doing enough to justify the extra cost of the gateway. There’s a break-even point, where they’ve done enough trade to justify a subscription gateway over PayPal etc., the point being that with MOST of the non-subscription services like iZettle or SumUp, there’s no gateway - so yes, the API and ready-made integrations for Square give it a huge advantage in that arena. By using it to start up and grow the business online, businesses save a lot. Going from zero online trade to £3000+ is rather nice without a monthly fee or a 36 month contract - as Streamline sold to one poor guy here! It’s my opinion that the reason for contract tie-ins (and making them long) is the banks’ fear of services like Square suddenly booming and killing the golden goose that Sagepay, Worldpay, and Streamline etc. have been benefiting from for so long. I’d like to help kill it, to be honest, hence my request to get Square set up in Quickfile. The major banks fleece people enough with interest, fees, and penalty charges, without getting a slice of every transaction made on the web as well.

"Point well made.  I was not criticising, just pointing out the break even level as I understood it. Certainly I would agree that it is worth considering for low t/o businesses or those where their average t/o over a year falls below the break even threshold. I guess it would be reasonably straight forward for QF to determine how many of their users, by turnover, would benefit by an integration to Square.  Only issue I can foresee is that most would probably be using QF subscription free based on their transaction level so a cost benefit analysis could well fail.

"In the past twelve months I have converted every customer that used Worldpay, and every customer the used Sagepay, plus several that used Paypal, to using Square payments for their business - at THEIR request.

They appear to have an e-commerce integration too, so it may be possible to embed the Square payment option within the client invoice preview screen.

So, I was looking for an alternative and found square. I was testing square in the last couple of month and it looks like they are pretty good.  So, long things short, yes I would be very happy to test square. 1 more thing, I hope that is okay: Over zapier, when a new transaction is send to quickfile it creates an invoice and except the amount everything looks fine. When there is no client so far with that name it creates a new client, but only the name is in the clients account. During the payment transaction the client provides everything important for the client account like address, email, phone and so on and square is sending this information but quickfile does not pick up all the information. As an feature in your new direct integration it would be fab if the client account would be created/filled completely, not only the name.

Quickbooks Self-employed has a way of “Separating business income and expenses from your personal transactions with a simple swipe” Is something like this possible with Quickfile - how can i easy categorise something to be a business or personal transaction from my Bank feed?

Personal expenses shouldn’t be recorded anyway. Quickbooks may let you seperate the two for your own information but in reality any personal expense should be tagged as either proprietor drawings or directors loan account depending on if your self employed or a Ltd company. If you have regular reoccurring personal expenses you can use auto tagging to tag them automatically to drawings. However if some expenses from the same company are sometimes business related that won’t work. ,129668,9383,Paul_Courtier,,35672,2,0,2020-06-06T18:11:39.294Z,2020-06-06T18:12:48.829Z,10,easy-way-of-seperating-personal-business-transactions,quickfile

"Hi [@Roy.Ferris](/u/roy.ferris) Unfortunately, I don’t believe the team we deal with aren’t able to deal with customers direct. To confirm the issue however, to give you a bit of context on the issue, when you try to connect a bank (any bank) through Open Banking, we’ll redirect you to the bank itself to authorise the account. When you authorise the feed, the bank will return you to a specific page which we tell them. Unfortunately, they’re not using the full link we’re providing to them, which is what’s causing you to see the home page. Due to this, we’re not able to get any of the data they’re supposed to be supplying to let us access your accounts for the feed. ![](https://community.quickfile.co.uk/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/r/77aa72/40.png) Roy.Ferris: > They confirm that Quickfile is sucessfully acessingn the Bank account and > that the download of the transactions is part of the Quickfile software and > they are unable to assist with the problem If the connection wasn’t complete (which seems to be the case on your account), then we wouldn’t be able to check the transactions.

"I am an affinity user migrating over to Linux (Ubuntu) from the out-of-support Windows 7 (I have set up dual boot), intending to drop W7 asap. I have re-set the Affinity password which works fine in Windows. When I logout of windows and into Ubuntu, the self-same password doesn’t work. I tried this twice with the same result (kinda not believing it!).  I have to log into Windows in safe mode with networking as it is constantly crashing in normal mode, and safe mode is far from ideal to complete accounts.As soon as I can I will take this to a technician to sort out but am too busy right now. Ubuntu does not crash on me - apparently it is a very ‘thin’ platform, which is much faster than windows when running many applications.  I have never managed to log into Quickfile yet from the Ubuntu platform. I have a VAT deadline approaching this month on the 6th, so I would appreciate a rapid solution from some kind soul please.  I had expected that as QF is cloud based it was unlikely there would be any issues. Taxfiler works just fine in Ubuntu, no different from what it does in Windows.  If this helps, I have just loaded a Windows emulator called Wine in Ubuntu, but it is more for Windows applications. Applications have to be downloaded from the internet and then loaded into Ubuntu using Wine. I am not sure if this could be a solution, the emulator did not work with the second application that I tried.  Assistance to solve this issue would be greatly appreciated.

You could try manually entering the opening balance in the euro bank account under settings.

Obviously remove this opening balance from your first journal. ,129324,9383,Paul_Courtier,,35591,2,0,2020-06-02T14:57:10.011Z,2020-06-02T14:57:10.011Z,6,opening-balance-for-foreign-account,quickfile
Thanks for the suggestion. That 98% fixed the problem. The new problem I have is that Quickfile automatically chose it’s own exchange rate that differs slightly from the one I had in my historical accounts.

"Probably the simplest fix would be to add the Euro account GBP equivalent opening balance to one of the other GBP bank accounts in the initial trial balance (so the Euro account has a starting balance of zero), then manually add a transaction to the Euro account for its opening balance in euros and tag that as a bank transfer to/from the account where you put the GBP equivalent.

Thanks in advance. ,129276,1481,w9gga,,35572,1,0,2020-06-01T10:59:50.955Z,2020-06-01T10:59:50.955Z,10,home-screen-dashboard-missing-logo,quickfile
"Hi [@w9gga](/u/w9gga) The logo was recently removed to give a bit more space to work in. If your account is owned by an Affinity account (e.g. if it was set up by the Affinity account), it will still show the Affinity customised logo.

OK thanks for letting me know Matthew. I myself never struggled for space but did find the logo to be a good visual cue as to which account I was working in. Its not a show stopper though I will just have to scroll to the top and read the account name instead. ,129281,1481,w9gga,2,35572,3,0,2020-06-01T12:58:42.774Z,2020-06-01T12:58:42.774Z,11,home-screen-dashboard-missing-logo,quickfile
Is there likely to be an option to enable the showing of the logo again? I work in several accounts and like the logo as it’s easier to see where I am and it’s a nice big object to click to get me back to the dashboard. I have noticed some of the success messages cover the menu so I have to wait for them to clear before I can navigate elsewhere. ,129404,655,Lurch,2,35572,4,1,2020-06-03T14:07:28.683Z,2020-06-03T14:07:28.683Z,7,home-screen-dashboard-missing-logo,quickfile
"Hi [@Lurch](/u/lurch) There are no plans to allow the logo to be shown again. Going forward, it’s only shown where an Affinity account is the owner (in which case, we’d shown the logo set in Affinity). If a logo is important to you, then there may be a way of doing this with some customer code, using the `prepend` function of jQuery? I haven’t tried this however. Although the logo has been removed, there’s still a “Dashboard” button in the top left, which is actually slightly bigger now than what it used to be. This would still take you back to the dashboard. I will certainly pass your feedback on in regards to the success message.

"At the moment I supply a number customers in EU countries. Some get charged VAT and some are registered for VAT in their own country. For non registered customers I charge VAT at the normal 20%. For registered customers there is a field on the customer file called ‘VAT Registered in another EC Member State’, under VAT settings. Check this and enter the customers VAT number. When you raise an order for one of those customers the VAT element is shown and then reversed out. When you complete a VAT return you will also Complete a ‘EC Sales List’ and this notifies who has had what and the VAT element. This is the current arrangement and will probably change at the end of the year. I imagine that at that point EU customers will classed as 'Export’and no VAT will be charged (out of scope).

When I manually set up the matching invoice in QF I can enter only one payment source and method, eg from bank account via PayPal. Is there any way of adding a second payment method, or am I coming at this from completely the wrong angle?

Yes we need it to allocate a reference code for each individual item. Currently we use the item field for the Date as each entry has a different date. As we need to seach for the date and for the code seperately we can only have two seperate columns.

"Hello As we have grown and I can no longer keep everything in my head, it has become difficult to audit/track/link activity within QuickFile and find the information that I am looking for. To give an example: I create a quote for laptops and cases and send it to a customer  The customer accepts the quote  I convert the quote to a sales invoice and leave it as a draft  I order the laptops on the quote from one supplier and the cases from another by creating purchase orders and dispatching those  The items start to be delivered to us or the customer and the purchase invoices start to be generated and entered  Once the customer has received everything, we dispatch the final sales invoice to them If I want to see an overview of all of this activity, I have to click into each item in the chain individually. E.g I want to see the PO reference for a purchase invoice, I have to click the PO or purchase invoice and then go to the bottom to read the notes about how it was generated. If there was an option to add (or it was added automatically) the PO reference to a purchase invoice and then display it as ‘our reference’ in addition to the ‘supplier reference’ in the purchase invoices listing, this would be useful.  Next, there is no easy way to link up a purchase with a sale. If I want to see where a laptop we purchased has been delivered, I can’t just search for the PO number even if the PO number is referenced on the supplier’s invoice. I think that’s one of the key things here - invoices we receive from suppliers usually have multiple references on them: Their reference, our reference and an invoice number. Some suppliers (and quickfile) make do with invoice number and purchase (the purchasing party’s) reference. I know that you are going to say that tagging is the answer here, and that maybe true, but having to remember to tag absolutely everything is a real challenge. Also, what tag format should be used for this scenario? It has to be unique, but what identifier would be relevant?  We already use tags for specific larger projects for the purpose of profit tracking and also to tag individual customer names on purchase invoices from our suppliers so that we can more easily identify that those 10 laptops from Acme Computers was actually destined for Community College. I’m getting myself in a muddle and any suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated. I’m not sure how other finance packages handle this?

In your Amazon and Paypal account within quickfile you have to enter the full sales and purchases amount you get from your customers or pay for purchases. If you use the paypal feed from quickfile this will happen automatically. Also the fee you pay to paypal, this will automatically show up up on your paypal account on the next day.

It’s perfectly fine and correct for a credit note to sometimes span other vat periods. If I bought something at the start of Jan and returned it 28 days later and received a refund as an example. The credit note would be dated 28 days after purchase. Not on the day I paid for it.

"Hi, I’ve just started preparing a VAT return and I’ve hit a bit of an issue with an Invoice with a negative total from a supplier. I’d already uploaded my bank statement which shows a refund from the supplier on the correct date (26th Feb), but when I entered the New Purchase it made its own duplicate entry in the bank account on the date of the credit note (22nd Feb). The question I have is how do I “tag” an existing bank transaction as the refund from a credit note? I’ve experimented a little bit and found the following limitations that I can’t work out a way around, but perhaps someone can tell me what I’m doing wrong here…  * The bank transaction that Quickfile automatically creates for a Credit Note appears on the day specified in the “Credit Note Date”. However, my particular Invoice contains a refund _and_ a purchase, but the net is negative. I don’t want to put the bank transaction date (26th Feb) in as the “Credit Note date” because that misrepresents the invoice issued date (22nd Feb).  * The description of the automatically created transaction is different to the description on the statement, and it doesn’t look like I can change it. I want the description of the bank account transaction to match the actual statements from my bank. Is there a way to do something similar to Invoices - i.e. “tag” an existing bank account transaction as the refund from a Credit Note, potentially on a different date to the invoice?

Short answer - no. Longer answer - if you create a credit note against a paid- up invoice and hold the credit on account rather than refunding it there and then, you should be able to subsequently go into the unallocated payment and “refund balance” on a different date. But for an ad-hoc credit note (a negative value invoice) not derived from another invoice I’m not aware of any way to make the bank transaction a different date from the credit note date.

"Thanks Ian. Not quite the answer I was hoping for, but at least it means I can stop looking for a workaround :-). As an aside I prefer things to fail safe, so I think it’s probably better to use the bank transaction date rather than the credit note “invoice date” (assuming there’s only one bank transaction and it’s not refunded in a split) - it means that if you re-upload the bank statement *.csv / *.qif file it will detect a duplicate transaction rather than blindly create another one because of the differing dates. If I can’t have a perfect audit trail for bank statements _and_ credit notes I’d rather have the former than the latter… Thanks again, Mike ",129118,9681,kingsland,,35504,4,0,2020-05-28T20:31:51.186Z,2020-05-28T20:31:51.186Z,8,assign-credit-note-to-uploaded-bank-statement-transaction,quickfile

"When you say you have credits for employers allowance, can you please clarify in what way is it a credit?

Only when you actually make employers ni payments would you record it. Can I also ask, is it likely you will use the smp ni compensation in this current tax year? If the answer is yes then you could simply record the paye details using a journal in the month its used and instead of including the full employers ni contribution reduce it by the amount your in credit by. After all, when you make a payment it will be less the credit anyway and so everything will balance. Theres no need to record any of these as an opening balance. If you will not use it due to employers allowance covering all employers ni payments then there’s nothing to record in quickfile.

"Hi James. Unfortunately I can’t see how I can help you in this instance, because I am of the opinion that it shouldn’t be recorded in the accounts as its not a company asset. I’ll try to explain. The credit you have with hmrc will only ever be used to reduce ni payments. If you used the credit to reduce the ni liability, then the only record in quickfile you would have is the actual ni paid to hmrc. The only payment out would be the actual ni paid over.

"Well not quite. The due balance would be just that. Whatever nic liability is due. If the EA clears any nic liability then the balance due would be zero. If however the EA doesn’t clear all nic liability then the balance due would be what’s remaining to be paid. Thus when the payments go out of your account, they match the balance in your paye liability nominal. Your payroll summary should look something like  Net pay  Tax and ni due  Gross pay  Employers ni  Less EA claimed If employers ni less EA claimed equals zero there’s no liability. As I said previously. EA isn’t an asset of the business. So you can’t record it as such. It’s an allowance. Hmrc credit the ni, not the business.  And any unused EA gets cleared in the new tax year.

"Is it possible to export Journals to a CSV file.

"You have to record cross-currency payments starting from the purchase itself - “log payment” on the purchase and you will have the option to set the foreign currency amount and the appropriate GBP amount and QuickFile will handle the exchange rate loss or gain. This will create a new pre-tagged transaction on the bank account, you then delete the untagged duplicate one. With the prepayment, I suspect what happened is that you tagged the transaction as a GBP prepayment, which can’t them be used to pay down an invoice in another currency.

"Hi all, i’m moving to Quickfile as it seems very powerful. I have a small property portfolio which I want to grow. I would like to know the best way to set this up.  I have 1 business bank account which i will integrate.  Business strategy: I loaned money to my LTD (directors loan) to buy property 1 then refurbished it (as uninhabitable), mortgaged the property and hand over to agent to let and manage. This process continues to build the portfolio using the mortgage proceeds to fund further purchases and again buying to refurb/refinance/rent. What is the best way to add everything into Quickfile - I would like to be able to run reports on each property to see expenditure/income - i guess this is tagging each property as a separate project to achieve this? Or should I add each property as a separate bank account (as per my prev software)?  I would also like to keep a record of mortgage balances - would this be adding each property as a loan account?  How would you add the outstanding balances as mortgage loans and how would you add the property as assets to the company.

You’re spot on - projects would be the way to achieve this. You can tag multiple sales and purchase invoices to a project (which you could use one project per property).

"Another vote for bank tagging to work for foreign currency invoices. I appreciate that QF can’t find the invoice as the amount won’t necessarily match, but would it be possible for the manual option _“tag multiple invoices”_ to show o/s invoices when the customer is selected? This could then take the user to the “log payment” screen to be completed as usual. It would just save a lot of time and multiple clicks. Currently, when a payment has been received and uploaded to the bank account, I have to do this after amending the invoice to show the correct exchange rate:  1. Copy the payment description from the bank feed.  2. Go back to the invoice and click “log payment” - complete this  3. Go back to the bank statement, paste the description on the entry created from the “log payment”.  4. Delete the untagged entry from the bank feed.  5.

"Hi [mesholmes1956](https://community.quickfile.co.uk/u/mesholmes1956),  First of all I am not an accountant and you should always ask your accountant for things like this. But in my understanding as an general rule I would say: After the end of your trading period, the opening stock must be transferred over to the Trading Account (within the Profit and Loss Account) where it is shown as the opening stock and it will be added to purchases to increase the cost of goods sold. The double entries required for this are: Debit Opening Stock Trading Account (nominal code 5200)  Credit Stock Account (nominal code 1001) Once you have transferred the opening stock over to the Trading Account this means that the account which records the value of the asset of stock (nominal code 1001) now has a nil balance. The closing stock valuation must now be recorded in the Stock Account (nominal code 1001) to record the value of the asset at the end of the trading period.  And a double entry must be made in the Trading Account (within the Profit and Loss Account) in order to reduce the cost of goods sold by the amount of the closing stock.  This requires the following book-keeping entries:  Debit Stock Account (nominal code 1001)  Credit Closing Stock Trading Account (nominal code 5201) I hope it helps a bit but as I said before you should ask your/an accountant ",128484,10457,rhc,,35356,2,1,2020-05-15T09:31:48.143Z,2020-05-15T09:31:48.143Z,16,year-end-stock-balance,quickfile

"I’ve just started running an online “click and collect” service for my business, with payments received via PayPal. The way the system works it takes payment from the customer when they place their order, but the sale only shows in the EPOS daily sales figures once the order has been collected. At the end of each day I get a report out of the EPOS giving the total completed sales for that day with the exact net and VAT totals (we sell a mixture of food at 0% and confectionery & toiletries at 20% so the amount of VAT varies from day to day). So what I’d like to be able to do is:  * use the PayPal feed to assign all the incoming payments as prepayments to a single client account but _not_ create any invoices  * have the feed account for the PayPal fees in the normal way  * I then take the report from the EPOS system, use that to create a sales invoice with the right net and VAT totals, and pay that invoice using the prepayment credits already received via PayPal. However I’m a bit stuck on point 1 - if I tell the PayPal feed settings to assign to a single client it will create invoices with the wrong VAT amount, but if I tell it to leave the tagging to me then the transaction descriptions of just “Client Name (PayPal reference number)” mean that there’s nothing they have in common that I can use to define a bank tagging rule. Is there anything I can do about this other than manually tagging every PayPal transaction individually or giving up on the feed and having to manually generate a PayPal report each day. Is it possible to add a prefix like ""PayPal payment from "" to the bank transactions generated from the feed, so they can be matched by a tagging rule?

"I think Steve Allen’s question related to what affect does it have on a self assessment form prior to making it a bad debt. The answer is depending on how you record your income on your self assessment. If you use the cash basis for tax, then it has no affect. Since you only record payments received. Whether you marked it as a bad debt or whether it remained unpaid, it’s the same thing. If however you don’t use the cash basis, then it’s recorded as turnover regardless of payment, until its recorded as a bad debt, and only then would you record it as a cost. If the bad debt was created in the following tax year then you will see a reduction in tax in that year. As opposed to the year in which it became due.

"So what exactly is going on here with who is invoicing whom? You’ve invoiced them for some things, you’ve also bought some things off them and resold those to other customers, and now the original supplier wants to offset what you owe to buy things off them against what they owe you? They still need to invoice you for the products you bought from them (for resale), then you can use a holding bank account to contra your purchase as part payment on the original invoice. Suppliers and clients are completely separate in QuickFile so you can’t directly move the credit from one to the other, you have to use a dummy bank account with a payment in “from a customer” and a matching payment out “to a supplier”.

"Please tell me if I’ve got this wrong at any point. First unless I’m mistaken you can’t credit note the customer because effectivly that will reduce your turnover each time you lower there balance. But they have asked that you sell their products in return for the money, so the turnover should remain the same and their balance remains the same until the products are sold. Once the products are sold you want to reduce the balance owed by the customer. This all seems straight enough but for ease perhaps this method is the best. Create a purchase at zero cost from the customer for the products you have sold. Mark it paid. Unless of course you actually paid for their products to resell in which case I’d suspect the markup on resell to be an amount you can offset against their balance so, the purchase receipt would be valued at cost price with a payment tagged to how you paid. The purcahase receipt category should be tagged to a capital account nominal so it stays clear of the p and l. It isn’t a business expense in theory it’s more like a capital asset. When you sell the products, split the transaction in two parts, the first amount being the cost of their product and the second being the amount of credit against their balance. Tag the first part of the transaction to the capital asset catagory you picked for the purchase(removing the asset from the balance sheet now it’s sold) , and the 2nd part of the transaction to the customer account. Then repay the customer balance from the customer account. Remember, if you purchase their product to resell and pay off their balance, don’t used the full amount you receive to reduce their balance, only the portion you made a profit on. If you allocate the part of the payment which covered the cost of you purchasing their product then your out of pocket and they gain from it.

Hi  We have group of small 4 companies. We are going to use quickfile just for VAT return using VAT bridging module. We do our accounts in excel. We have just bought one power user subscription. Is one power user subscription is enough to submit VAT return using bridging module for all 4 companies or do we have to pay for VAT bridging module for each company. ?

We have opted to use a technology that will allow us to support Android and iOS simultaneously from a single code-base. With that said there are some modifications that we need to make to ensure a smooth experience for iOS users. We’re working on this now and hope to have an iOS version ready in a few weeks. # What can the App do? We’re looking at the common use cases where mobile can deliver a better experience than desktop and prioritising the work accordingly to deliver these features. The obvious place to start was receipt capture and tagging. Version 1.0 of the app will allow you to do the following. >  * Capture receipts from the camera or upload from your gallery >  * Tag your receipts with a mobile version of the Receipt Hub tagging > interface >  * Access all your receipts from the Receipt Hub and view corresponding > purchase invoice metadata. >  * Switch between multiple QuickFile accounts > # What’s coming next? The next stage of development will focus on read-only access to your quotations, invoices and bank transactions. This will allow you to quickly check various things while on the move. Later we’ll look at the ability to create quotations and invoices from a paired down mobile interface. We’re not planning to have absolute feature parity with the web app but we’ll aim to cover the broader scenarios that will allow you to be more productive on the move. That’s it for now… We’ll provide further updates on our mobile app journey soon.
